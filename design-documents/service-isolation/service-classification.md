# Service Classification

## Overview

A microservice should solve a particular business problem, more like a single responsiblity pattern. Techniques such as Domain Driven Design (DDD) can be extremely helpful to navigate through the business use-cases, identifying / exploring context boundaries, business events and state changes. 

At the same-time it becomes confusing what responsibilities should be assigned to a particular Microservice, where it should be deployed, and how it relates to other services?

A better service classification with proper separate of concerns and responsibility matrix could allow us to design and distribute the responsibilities of a particular Microservice; and it can also gives us a framework to start thinking about the design.
